This little text adventure game was created purely for fun. 

How To:
To play this game, download this repository to your computer and open up index.html file. It should run automatically.

It is unfinished but I hope to add onto it or make a more well thought out story in the future but for now enjoy my very basic first version of this text adventure game.

This project was originally inspired by this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA
