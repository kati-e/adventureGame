This little text adventure game was created purely for fun. 

How To:
To play this game, download this repository to your computer and open up in your IDE -- you will need to use a live server plugin to assist in running this to allow for the fetch otherwise if you just open in the browser it will give you a CORS restriction. I use VS Code with Live Server Extension: https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/

It is unfinished but I hope to add onto it or make a more well thought out story in the future but for now enjoy my very basic first version of this text adventure game.

This project was originally inspired by this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA
